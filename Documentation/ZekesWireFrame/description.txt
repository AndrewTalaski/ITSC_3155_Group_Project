The idea with my version, is there are 2 types of pages: Profile pages and Network pages

When you view your own profile page, you can edit your wish list. When you view other profile pages you can  add an item as "I am getting this"

MISSING: Own profile page needs list of gifts you are getting for other people

Network pages shows all of your "friends" and you can click on them to go to their profile page. You can also see people that are 1 friend removed
